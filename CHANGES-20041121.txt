w_cb	Support readonly access to an MFS in an inconsistent state.

JBeuhl  Export expiration date in mfs_tmfstream; patch to mfs_ftp to
        use it (mfs_ftp.jbuehl.patch).

Jamie	Makefile options for static builds, and to use a library .so
	for common code.

	Merge mfs_export, mfs_stream, mfs_tarexport, mfs_tmfexport into
        a new program, mfs_uberexport, and add cover scripts to
        emulate old cmdlines.

	Support ty+ in mfs_uberexport  (-Rx <path|fsid>)

	Patch to mfs_ftp to use mfs_uberexport and mfs_import
	(mfs_ftp.jamie.patch).

JBeuhl  Enhancements to the MFS_DEVICE envvar handling to support
        multidisk configurations with interleaved layouts for PC side
        extraction.  This can occur if a B drive is added followed by 
	an A drive expansion. The previous multidisk code from JonBig
	didn't handle these cases.   See README.MFS_DEVICE for details.
